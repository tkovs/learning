{-
	Why is it not feasible in general for function types to be instances of the
	Eq class? When is it feasible? Hint: two functions of the same type are
	equal if they always return equal results for equal arguments.

	ANSWER
	oh my fucking god, it would give so much work, it's not feasible coz it can
	receive infinite possible arguments.
